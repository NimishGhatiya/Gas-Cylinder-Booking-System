This project is a comprehensive Gas Cylinder Booking System API built to manage the entire lifecycle of gas cylinder ordering and delivery. Developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, it provides a robust backend solution for a booking platform. The system is designed with a multi-user architecture featuring three distinct roles:

ğŸ‘¤ Customer: Can register, book cylinders, and track their order status.

ğŸšš Supplier: Manages inventory, views assigned bookings, and updates delivery status.

ğŸ‘‘ Admin: Oversees the entire system, manages users (customers and suppliers), and views all bookings.
